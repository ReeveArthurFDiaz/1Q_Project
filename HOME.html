				<p id="exp1">For multiple years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has turned tables. Instead of a war, a genocide is seen by the naked eye in the streets of Gaza and other cities in Palestine. Million civilians have been displaced, killed, stripped off their homes, lost work and proper education, and cried for help. According to the Human Rights Watch (2024), "During the first eight months of 2023, incidents of settler violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average since the UN started recording this data in 2006: an average of three incidents per day as compared to two per day in 2022 and one in 2021. This included rampages by mobs of settler in Huwara and Turmus Ayya. That rate increased to over five incidents per day after October 7." <p>

				<p id="stattext"> These statistics were collected from AP World News. The comparison of the magnitude of damage towards Israel and vice versa shows a huge difference. According to AP News, 86% of Palestine's pre-war population, around 1.9 million people, are currently displaced. This could mean that they possibly left their homes to keep safe from aerial attacks. Another statistic from the site states that at least 21 cemeteries in Gaza have been damaged. It's an unsettling fact that even the dead are being disturbed because of this catastrophic attack. With the second and third statistic given, it is also evident that Palestinian infrastructure was washed away by the Israelian weaponry. What's more concerning is that amidst the need for refuge and hospitals for the injured, statistics also show that only 16 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza are partially functioning. </p>
